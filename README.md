## AUKUS and the Gravity Framework: Trade Diversion or Creation?

This repository contains the code and materials for our policy brief analyzing the impact of the AUKUS security agreement on Australia’s international trade patterns. This project analyzes whether the 2021 AUKUS security agreement between Australia, the UK, and the US led to trade diversion from China or trade creation with AUKUS partners. It includes a policy brief, replication code in R (.Rmd, .html), and a gravity model estimated using PPML. Data sources include UN Comtrade, World Bank, CEPII, and GTA.

###  Summary

We apply a gravity model to evaluate the trade effects of the AUKUS partnership announced in September 2021. Our findings suggest:
- Trade with China fell significantly post-AUKUS.
- No substantial trade creation with AUKUS partners (UK, US) was observed.
- Geopolitical alignment continues to play a key role in trade flows.
- 
We find evidence that Australia’s accession to AUKUS has contributed to trade diversion away from China without generating offsetting trade creation with AUKUS partners, highlighting potential economic costs to its geopolitical realignment.
